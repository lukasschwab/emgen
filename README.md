## Usage

More specifically, a faster email generator than [EmailGenerator.io](http://emailgenerator.io/), which I have used a lot. Big ups to that team––just wasn't cutting it for me anymore!

1. Go to [lukasschwab.github.io/emgen](https://lukasschwab.github.io/emgen/).

2. Type in the required information.

3. Hit "generate."

## To do

```
[✓] Links to my github/blog
[ ] Make it configurable
[ ] Add more email combos: firstl, lfirst...
[✓] Clean up extra comma at end of sequence
[✓] Replace document.getElementById with one call
[ ] Make the CSS smaller
[ ] Favicon
[✓] Automatically select emails after generation
```
